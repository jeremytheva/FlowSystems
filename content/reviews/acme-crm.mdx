# Acme CRM Review: Who it's best for

> TL;DR Verdict: Acme CRM is the fastest solo-friendly CRM when you need automation without spending a weekend configuring it.

## What jobs Acme CRM solves
Acme CRM focuses on solos running high-touch client pipelines. The kanban pipeline, quick tasks, and AI follow-up prompts make it easy to keep deals moving without context switching.

## Setup & Onboarding (Setup Effort)
Guided import steps pull from spreadsheets, Stripe, or Notion in minutes. The wizard flags missing fields and suggests automations you can enable later.

## What you get in week 1 (Time-to-Value)
Expect a ready-to-send follow-up engine. The automation builder ships with sequences for lead capture and contract reminders that you can clone in a click.

## Pricing & Plans
Starts at $29/mo for solos with unlimited pipelines. Teams unlock collaboration tools at $59/mo.

## Integrations & Ecosystem
Native connections cover Google Workspace, Calendly, and Zapier. Webhooks plus the REST API allow deeper workflows.

## Support & Docs
Weekly office hours and an async forum staffed by product specialists.
