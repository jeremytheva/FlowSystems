# Branch Audit Summary

Date: 2025-11-03T00:11:13Z

- Active branch: `work`
- Other local branches: None
- Remote branches: None configured

All repository history is linear on `work`, so there were no divergent branches to merge. Added a `.gitignore` to prevent transient artifacts such as `node_modules/` from polluting future branch comparisons.
