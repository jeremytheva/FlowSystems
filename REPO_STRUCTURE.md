## Follow-up Suggestions
1. Flesh out the numerous ‚ö†Ô∏è dynamic and admin routes with real data fetching, form handling, or at least TODO comments that outline the intended experience.
2. Populate the scoring weight JSON stubs and connect them to the scoring API so evaluation endpoints and admin views share consistent sample data.
3. Replace the placeholder `README.md` with setup instructions, architectural overview, and contribution guidelines to help new collaborators get started.
