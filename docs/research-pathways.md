# Research Pathways

The research backlog aligns discovery work with module priorities to ensure each flow ships with validated operator insights.

## Immediate Research Themes
- **Automation Outcomes (WorkflowFlow + GovernFlow):** Interview operators running hybrid automation stacks to map key metrics, risks, and success patterns.
- **Brand-to-Demand Alignment (BrandingFlow + AttractFlow):** Conduct concept tests on messaging frameworks to validate tone assistant recommendations and landing page structures.
- **Client Collaboration (ServeFlow):** Observe proposal reviews and handoff processes to inform portal requirements and governance logs.

## Secondary Themes
- **Knowledge Compounding (EvolveFlow):** Evaluate existing knowledge bases and community contribution models to shape import/export experiences.
- **Strategic Planning (StrategyFlow):** Benchmark goal-mapping tools and strategy canvases to refine FlowBotCore-powered insights.

## Research Operations Checklist
- Pair each study with a FlowBotCore prompt log to capture how insights should influence automation and templates.
- Store interview summaries in EvolveFlow once the knowledge hub is ready, maintaining traceability back to participants.
- Feed telemetry hypotheses from research into the GovernFlow analytics backlog for instrumentation.
