# Implementation Roadmap

This roadmap prioritises the rollout of the unified Flow Systems modules. It references the Unified Feature Integration Matrix (2025-11-03) and Simplified Module Map to keep delivery aligned with business outcomes.

## Phase 1 — MVP Activation
- FlowBotCore — Harden prompt orchestration, integration registry, and template rendering.
- WorkflowFlow — Deliver automation studio scaffolding, blueprint registration, and scheduling primitives.
- ServeFlow — Establish proposal generator and client portal skeleton integrated with FlowBotCore templates.
- BrandingFlow — Implement identity canvas and tone assistant for go-to-market enablement.
- StrategyFlow — Ship goal mapper and model generator stubs to inform prioritisation.
- GovernFlow — Stand up analytics shell and governance log streaming to observe flow health.

## Phase 2 — Expansion
- AttractFlow — Connect landing page/email builder to automation triggers and analytics loops.
- EvolveFlow — Launch knowledge hub search, import/export pipelines, and community contribution workflows.
- Finance/Telemetry Integrations — Extend GovernFlow data model with financial and telemetry sources once available.

## Dependencies & Milestones
- FlowBotCore must reach stable template APIs before ServeFlow or AttractFlow go live.
- WorkflowFlow automation events are prerequisites for GovernFlow dashboards.
- Knowledge contributions flowing into EvolveFlow should sync back to FlowBotCore before phase 2 reporting.
